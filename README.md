# MoodNFT üé≠

**MoodNFT** is an on-chain ERC721 NFT project that reflects the **mood of the NFT owner**. Each NFT can toggle between two moods: **Happy** and **Sad**. The entire NFT metadata and SVG images are stored on-chain, ensuring the data is immutable and decentralized.

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **Dynamic Mood Flipping**:  
  NFT owners can **flip the mood** of their NFT between **Happy** and **Sad**.

- **On-Chain Storage**:  
  Uses **OpenZeppelin's Base64 encoding** to store metadata and SVG images completely on-chain. No reliance on external storage solutions like IPFS.
  
- **Customizable Images**:  
  Mood-specific SVG images are set at deployment, allowing for unique and flexible designs.

- **100% Decentralized Metadata**:  
  Metadata, including name, description, attributes, and image URI, is stored fully on-chain in Base64 format.

## How It Works üöÄ

1. **Minting**:  
   Users can mint a `MoodNFT`, which starts in the **Happy** mood by default.
   
2. **Mood Flipping**:  
   The owner can toggle the mood between **Happy** and **Sad** using the `flipMood` function.

3. **On-Chain Metadata**:  
   The `tokenURI` function encodes metadata as JSON and images as SVG directly into the blockchain.
